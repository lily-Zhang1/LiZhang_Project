The whole workflow of the project is shown in the figure below:

The functions of each file are as follows:

1. carto.py & render_tiles.py: generate map images
2. train.csv: labels
3. trainset-0905.py: dataloader
4. train_placesCNN-0905.py: training code
5. Gennerate confusion matrix.cpp: delete the brackets of the confusion matrix
